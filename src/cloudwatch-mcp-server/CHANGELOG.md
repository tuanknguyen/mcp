## Unreleased

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- Added optional `queries` parameter to `get_metric_data` for advanced metric retrieval: percentile statistics (p50, p90, p99, ...), metric math expressions, and multi-metric batching in a single API call
- Added `MetricStatInput` and `MetricDataQueryInput` Pydantic input models for the `queries` parameter, with mutually-exclusive validation between `metric_stat` and `expression`
- Automatic `NextToken` pagination in the `queries` path so large responses are not silently truncated

### Changed

- `start_time` parameter on `get_metric_data` is now optional; defaults to 3 hours before `end_time` when omitted (matches the CloudWatch console default)
