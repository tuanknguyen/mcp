        Prefer this over ``remove()`` when evicting a connection you already
        hold a reference to (e.g. cleaning up a failed/rejected connection in
        ``connect_to_database``).

        Why: the map key is built from the AWS-*resolved* endpoint/port, and
        ``set()`` does not receive ``port`` (so it is always stored as the
        5432 default), whereas callers pass the *caller-supplied* endpoint/port
        to ``get()``/``remove()``. Those keys can diverge (empty db_endpoint,
        non-5432 port, differing host casing), which makes key-based
        ``remove()`` silently no-op and leave the connection cached. Evicting
        by identity sidesteps that entirely. See the tracked follow-up on
        connection-map key normalization for the broader fix.

            True if a matching connection was found and removed, else False.
