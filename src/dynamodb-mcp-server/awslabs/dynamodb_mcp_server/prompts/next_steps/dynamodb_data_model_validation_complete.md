## Next Steps

Validation complete! Choose your next action:

**Option 1: Deploy to AWS** - Generate a CDK app to provision your DynamoDB tables and GSIs in your AWS account. To deploy, say "generate CDK app" or "create deployment package".

**Option 2: Generate Python code** - Create type-safe entity classes, repository classes with CRUD operations, and usage examples for local development. To generate code, say "generate Python code" or "generate data access layer".

You can do both - deploy infrastructure first, then generate code to interact with your tables.
