## Next Steps

Data modeling complete! Choose your next action:

**Option 1: Validate the model** (recommended) - Test all access patterns against DynamoDB Local to verify your design works correctly. This will guide you to create the required `dynamodb_data_model.json` file if it doesn't exist. After validation, you can deploy with CDK or generate Python code. To validate, say "validate my data model" or "run validation".

**Option 2: Generate Python code** - Convert your data model to schema.json and generate type-safe entities and repositories for local development. To proceed, say "generate code" or "convert to schema.json".

Note: To deploy with CDK, you'll need to create `dynamodb_data_model.json` first. The validation tool will guide you through this process.
