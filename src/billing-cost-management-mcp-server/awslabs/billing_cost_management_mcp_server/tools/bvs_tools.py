    description="""Returns the metadata associated to the specified billing view ARN.

A billing view is an AWS resource that defines a segment of AWS cost management data.
There are four types of billing views:
- PRIMARY: The default billing view containing all cost management data for an account.
  For management accounts in an organization, this includes all data across the organization.
- BILLING_GROUP: Billing views corresponding to billing groups created in AWS Billing Conductor.
- CUSTOM: Customer-created billing views that provide filtered cost visibility across organizations.
  These can be shared with other accounts.
- BILLING_TRANSFER: Views available when using billing transfer, including "My view" and
  "Showback/chargeback view".
- BILLING_TRANSFER_SHOWBACK: Shows billing data configured for showback or chargeback purposes.

The tool returns information about:
- Billing view ARN, name, and description
- Billing view type (PRIMARY, BILLING_GROUP, CUSTOM, BILLING_TRANSFER, BILLING_TRANSFER_SHOWBACK)
- Owner account ID and source account ID
- Data filter expression (dimensions, tags, cost categories, time range)
- Health status (status code and reasons)
- Derived view count and source view count
- Creation, update, and view definition last updated timestamps

Example: {"arn": "arn:aws:billing::123456789012:billingview/custom-view-abc123"}""",

Every AWS account has a unique PRIMARY billing view that represents the billing data
available by default. Accounts that use AWS Billing Conductor also have BILLING_GROUP
billing views representing pro forma costs associated with each created billing group.

If activeTimeRange is provided, only billing views that were active during that time window are returned.
Else, all billing views that ever existed are returned, including views for deleted billing groups and ended billing transfers.

The tool returns a list of billing views with information about:
- Billing view ARN, name, and description
- Billing view type (PRIMARY, BILLING_GROUP, CUSTOM, BILLING_TRANSFER, BILLING_TRANSFER_SHOWBACK)
- Owner account ID and source account ID
- Health status (status code and reasons)

You can filter billing views by:
- active_after_inclusive / active_before_inclusive: UTC time range for listing billing views
  (must be within one calendar month, both must be provided together).
  Format: YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS (all times are in UTC).
  PRIMARY billing views are always listed. BILLING_GROUP billing views are listed for time
  ranges when the associated billing group resource in AWS Billing Conductor is active.
- arns: Filter by specific billing view ARNs (maximum 10 items)
- billing_view_types: Filter by type (PRIMARY, BILLING_GROUP, CUSTOM, BILLING_TRANSFER,
  BILLING_TRANSFER_SHOWBACK)
- names: Filter by name using search criteria (supports STARTS_WITH search option)
- owner_account_id: Filter by owner account ID (12-digit AWS account ID)
- source_account_id: Filter by source account ID (12-digit AWS account ID)
- max_results: Maximum number of billing views per page (1-100, default 100)

The tool paginates through results up to max_pages pages (default 10).
If more results are available after reaching the page limit, a next_token is returned.
Pass the next_token back to this tool to continue fetching from where you left off.

is built from.

A custom billing view is created as a "multi-source view" by combining cost management data
from up to 20 source views. Source views are managed billing views (typically PRIMARY or other
CUSTOM billing views) from the same or different AWS organizations. This enables consolidation
of cost management data across multiple organizations into a single custom billing view.

Use this tool to:
- Understand the data lineage of a custom billing view (which source views feed its data)
- Debug health issues: if a custom view is UNHEALTHY with SOURCE_VIEW_UNHEALTHY or
  SOURCE_VIEW_ACCESS_DENIED, inspect its source views to identify the problem
- Audit cross-organization data consolidation (which orgs/accounts contribute to this view)
- Determine if the custom billing view aggregates data from a single org or multiple orgs

Resource-based policies are used to control access to billing view resources. When a custom
billing view is shared with other accounts (within or outside the organization) using AWS
Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM), a resource-based policy is attached to the billing view
resource defining the access permissions.

Use this tool to:
- Inspect the sharing permissions of a billing view to understand which accounts have access
- Audit resource-based policy configurations for compliance or security review
- Debug access issues by examining the policy document attached to a billing view
- Verify that sharing was configured correctly after sharing a custom billing view

the billing domain (PRO_FORMA or BILLABLE) and the account relationships that apply during its time range.

A billing view segment represents a time range during which the billing domain and account relationships
for a billing view remained unchanged. If a mid-period change occurs (for example, an account joins or
leaves a billing group), the response includes multiple segments, each with its own time range. Hidden
segments are omitted, so the returned segments might not cover the entire requested time period.

Use this tool to:
- Determine whether an account's costs are BILLABLE (real charges owed to AWS) or PRO_FORMA (shaped by
  AWS Billing Conductor, not final charges)
- Identify mid-period changes in billing relationships (e.g., an account moving between billing groups)
- Audit the billing group or billing transfer account relationships that applied during a specific period
- Understand the management account hierarchy for organization member accounts

Parameters:
- arn: Optional billing view ARN. If omitted, the caller's PRIMARY billing view is used.
  Must reference a primary billing view; custom billing views are not supported.
- begin_date_inclusive / end_date_exclusive: Optional UTC time range for the billing period.
  Format: YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS (UTC). Both must be provided together.
  If omitted, the current billing period (calendar month in UTC) is used.
- max_results: Segments per page, 1-100 (default 100).
- max_pages: Pages to auto-fetch (default 10).
- next_token: Pagination token from a previous response.

Each segment in `data.segments` contains:
- domain: BILLABLE or PRO_FORMA
- management_account_id: The management account of the organization (for org member accounts)
- billing_group_primary_account_id: The billing group primary account (for billing group members)
- billing_transfer_account_id: The billing transfer account (only for billing transfer source accounts)
