"""AWS Invoice Unit tools for the AWS Billing and Cost Management MCP server.

Exposes a single read-only ``invoice-units`` tool that routes by ``operation``
across the AWS Invoice Configuration read APIs (mirroring the ``invoicing``
tool). The rich tool description is the primary vehicle that gives the agent
semantic context about every request parameter and response field.

    description="""Access AWS Invoice Configuration (invoice units) — read-only. Invoice units are groups of AWS accounts that represent business entities and receive a separate invoice, each with a designated receiver account. Choose an action with the required `operation` parameter; the remaining parameters apply to specific operations.

## OPERATIONS

1) list_invoice_units - list invoice unit definitions visible to the management account
   Required: operation="list_invoice_units"
   Optional filters (AND across types; OR within a list). Account IDs are 12-digit AWS account IDs:
     - names: match invoice unit names
     - invoice_receivers: match the invoice unit's receiver account
     - bill_source_accounts: match a bill-source account
     - accounts: global search — matches invoice units where the account appears as the receiver, a linked (member) account, OR a bill-source account
     - as_of: point-in-time UTC "YYYY-MM-DD" or "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS" (definitions as of that instant; defaults to current)
   Pagination: max_results caps items per page (1-500); max_pages caps pages fetched (default: all). The `pagination` block reports total_results, pages_fetched, has_more, and next_token.
   Returns: `data.invoice_units`, each with InvoiceUnitArn, Name, Description, InvoiceReceiver, TaxInheritanceDisabled, Rule {LinkedAccounts}, and LastModified (ISO 8601 UTC).

2) get_invoice_unit - retrieve one invoice unit definition
   Required: operation="get_invoice_unit", invoice_unit_arn
   Optional: as_of (point-in-time UTC, as above)
   Returns: `data.invoice_unit` with the fields above.

3) batch_get_invoice_profile - fetch invoice receiver profiles for accounts
   Required: operation="batch_get_invoice_profile", account_ids (12-digit AWS account IDs; linked accounts or the payer account)
   Returns: `data.profiles`, each with AccountId, ReceiverName, ReceiverAddress, ReceiverEmail, Issuer, TaxRegistrationNumber.
