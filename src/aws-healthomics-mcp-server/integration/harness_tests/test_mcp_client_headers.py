"""Offline unit tests for HarnessMcpClient request headers.

Pure and offline: the streamable-http transport and MCP client session are patched with
fakes, so opening a session performs no network I/O. The tests assert that a default
``User-Agent`` header is always sent (the AWS WAF fronting the AgentCore endpoint rejects
requests without one, which manifested as a silent connection timeout), and that a
caller-supplied ``User-Agent`` overrides the default.

Validates: Requirements Remote transport end-to-end verification.
