"""Offline guard: the harness container image must not bundle provisioning code.

The deployed AgentCore test container only needs the runtime entrypoint and the shared
header constants. The provisioning modules (``deploy/agentcore``, ``apigateway``, ``cli``,
``iam``, ``cognito``, ``registry``, ``common``) create/delete real AWS infrastructure and
shell out via ``subprocess``; bundling them into a network-reachable container would put
those primitives inside the blast radius of a server compromise. This test parses the
image Dockerfile's ``COPY`` directives and asserts that none of the provisioning modules
(nor the whole ``integration`` tree) is copied into the image, while the required runtime
files are.

Validates: Requirements Harness location and offline isolation.
