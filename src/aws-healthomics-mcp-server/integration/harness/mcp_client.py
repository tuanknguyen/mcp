"""Thin streamable-http MCP client and offline-testable retry policy.

This module wraps the official MCP Python SDK's ``streamable-http`` client transport in a
small, purpose-built client (:class:`HarnessMcpClient`) used by the transport and isolation
integration tests, and provides a transport-agnostic retry helper (:func:`with_retries`).

The retry helper takes injectable ``sleep`` and ``now`` seams so the retry policy can be
property-tested fully offline with a fake clock (no real waiting, no AWS, no network). The
client itself performs no work until :meth:`HarnessMcpClient.open_session` is called, so
importing this module stays offline.
