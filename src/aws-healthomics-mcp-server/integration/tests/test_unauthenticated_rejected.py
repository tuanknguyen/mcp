"""Boundary rejection of unauthenticated and invalid-credential requests (live AWS).

This opt-in integration module asserts the Server's fronting layer terminates inbound
authentication at its boundary: a request that presents no credential, and a request that
presents an invalid/garbage credential, is rejected *before* it can reach the Server, so no
tool ever runs. For the AgentCore deployment this rejection is performed by AgentCore
Runtime's inbound authorizer ("AgentCore deployment demonstration"); for the API Gateway
deployment it is performed by the gateway's authorizer, which does not forward the request to
the loopback-bound Server ("API Gateway deployment demonstration"). In both cases a request
carrying no inbound identity that any enabled mechanism can authenticate is refused at the
boundary before any tool call is attempted ("Cross-tenant isolation verification" -- inbound
identity is required before any tool runs).

The most direct signal for boundary auth termination is the HTTP status: a rejected request
receives an HTTP 401 (preferred) or 403 and is never forwarded, so the response is never a
successful (2xx) tool exchange. This module issues a direct HTTP request to the fronting-layer
endpoint -- once with no ``Authorization`` header and once with a deliberately invalid bearer
token -- and asserts each is rejected with 401/403 and that no successful tool exchange
occurred.

The test is gated behind the Opt_In_Signal (``RUN_REMOTE_INTEGRATION_TESTS``) by the
collection hook in ``integration/conftest.py`` and is skipped by default. When the signal is
present it resolves the fronting-layer endpoint from the environment via the
``require_inputs`` fixture and skips -- rather than fails -- when that input is absent. Because
the skip is applied at collection time, no AWS client is constructed offline.

Additional fail-closed multi-tenant assertions (unregistered identity, disabled record,
unauthenticable request) are appended to this module by a later task; the shared endpoint
input, request helper, and rejection-status constants below are intended to be reused by
those tests.
