"""Harness deployment entrypoint for the remote-deployment integration tests.

This module is harness-owned code that lives inside the deployed container/process
only. It imports the *unmodified* server ``mcp`` instance and ``main`` entrypoint and
registers a single additional read-only ``WhoAmI`` tool used by the cross-tenant
isolation tests to observe the effective assumed-role identity of a request.

No server-package source is modified: the extra tool is attached to the already
constructed ``mcp`` instance at import time, and the server is started via its own
``main()``.

Because ``get_aws_session()`` resolves through the active credential resolver (the
``RequestScopedCredentialResolver`` when multi-tenant mode is enabled), the STS
identity returned by ``WhoAmI`` reflects the per-request assumed Tenant_Role — exactly
the signal the isolation tests compare against the expected Tenant_Role (Req 6.2).

The tool is strictly read-only and returns no Credential_Material: only the caller's
STS ARN, account id, and user id are returned.

    """Force stateless mode and a relaxed Host allow-list on every app the server builds.

    AgentCore Runtime automatically injects an ``Mcp-Session-Id`` header on every request; a
    stateful MCP server treats that as an unknown session and rejects the request with HTTP 421
    (Misdirected Request), so the streamable-http transport must run stateless. AgentCore also
    forwards requests with a non-loopback ``Host`` header, which the transport's default
    DNS-rebinding allow-list (loopback-only) likewise rejects with HTTP 421; that protection
    guards browser-origin attacks against locally-bound servers, and behind AgentCore the
    container is not browser-reachable and AgentCore is the sole, authenticated ingress, so
    relaxing it here is safe.

    SDK v2 moved both ``stateless_http`` and ``transport_security`` off ``mcp.settings`` and onto
    ``streamable_http_app()``/``sse_app()`` keyword arguments (mirroring host/port/path), so
    there is no longer a settings object to mutate before ``main()`` runs. Both the single-tenant
    path (``TransportSelector.start`` -> ``mcp.run`` -> ``run_streamable_http_async`` /
    ``run_sse_async``) and the multi-tenant path (``_run_multi_tenant`` calling
    ``mcp_instance.streamable_http_app()`` / ``sse_app()`` directly) end up calling those same two
    methods on the ``mcp`` instance, so wrapping them here covers both without touching
