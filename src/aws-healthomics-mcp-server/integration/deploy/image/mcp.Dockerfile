# Harness deployment image for the remote-deployment integration tests
# (AgentCore_Deployment, Req 2.1).
#
# This image packages the *unmodified* AWS HealthOmics MCP Server and starts it
# through the harness-owned entrypoint (integration/deploy/image/entrypoint.py),
# which imports the server's `mcp` instance + `main`, registers the read-only
# `WhoAmI` isolation tool, and calls `main()`. No server-package source is
# modified.
#
# It mirrors the project's root Dockerfile conventions: the same amazonlinux
# base, a multi-stage uv-based dependency install, and a non-root `app` user.
# The difference is that this image also copies the `integration/` package into
# the final stage (the root image installs only the server package into the
# venv) and starts the harness entrypoint module instead of the console script.
#
# BUILD CONTEXT: this Dockerfile MUST be built from the PROJECT ROOT so the
# server sources, lockfiles, and the integration/ package are all in context:
#
#   docker build -f integration/deploy/image/mcp.Dockerfile -t aho-mcp-itest .
#
# PORT / TRANSPORT (Req 2.1): AgentCore Runtime routes inbound MCP traffic to
# the container on port 8080 (the standard AgentCore container port), so the
# server is started with the streamable-http transport bound to 0.0.0.0:8080.
# The server binds 0.0.0.0 (not the loopback default) because AgentCore's
# managed ingress reaches the container over its network interface; AgentCore
# Runtime is the sole network-reachable ingress (Req 2.4), so the container port
# is never otherwise exposed. The server emits its expected non-loopback
# exposure warning; inbound authentication is terminated at the AgentCore
# boundary.
#
# Multi-tenant/JWT settings (MCP_MULTI_TENANT, MCP_INBOUND_AUTH,
# MCP_JWT_ROLE_REGISTRY) are injected at deploy time by the AgentCore deployment
# (task 10.1), not baked into the image. The image's responsibility per Req 2.1
# is the transport + port binding.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# dependabot should continue to update this to the latest hash.
